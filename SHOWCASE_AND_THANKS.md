[Do Práce na Kole](https://www.dopracenakole.cz/) (Open source on [github](https://github.com/auto-mat/do-prace-na-kole))

Do Práce na Kole is a month long bike to work challenge in the Czech Republic. It is run by the non profit [Auto-mat z.s.](https://auto-mat.cz). django-import-export-celery is used to import discount codes from our eshop and export lists of users for data-anaylsis using jupyter.

Auto-mat z.s. also uses django-import-export-celery for its internal donor database [klub přatel](https://github.com/auto-mat/klub) (also open source).
